  - [x] Logging setup
  - [x] Main workflow implementation:
    - [x] Load and validate analyzer schema from JSON files
    - [x] Upload/update schema to Content Understanding endpoint
    - [x] Multiple execution modes (health, interactive, list-analyzers, create-analyzer, test-analysis)
    - [x] Select sample document for analysis
    - [x] Submit document for processing
    - [x] Poll for completion and retrieve results using Operation-Location header
    - [x] Display extracted data in readable format (JSON and markdown)

### Phase 4: Sample Data and Testing

- [x] **Create Sample Documents - provided by author**
  - [x] Added sample PDF/image files to test with (receipt1.pdf and others)
  - [x] Include various document types that match analyzer schema  
  - [x] Store in project Data/SampleDocuments folder

- [x] **Implement Basic Document Analysis**
  - [x] Complete end-to-end document analysis workflow working
  - [x] Receipt analyzer successfully extracts VendorName and Items
  - [x] Operation-Location header polling implemented correctly
  - [x] Real-time status tracking and result parsing

- [x] **Implement Error Handling and Validation**
  - [x] Enhanced HTTP status code handling for API calls
  - [x] Pass-through server error responses for transparency
  - [x] Validate configuration and required parameters
  - [x] Create meaningful error messages for users
  - [x] Handle edge cases in document analysis workflow

### Phase 5: Documentation and User Experience

- [x] **Create Documentation**
  - [x] README.md with:
    - [x] Project overview and capabilities
    - [x] Prerequisites and setup instructions
    - [x] One-click deployment guide
    - [x] Usage examples and sample output
    - [x] Architecture diagram
    - [x] Troubleshooting section
